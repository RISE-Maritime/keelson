# Documentation

MkDocs site using Material theme with slate color scheme.

## Building Docs

```bash
# Generate docs from proto definitions (from repo root)
./generate_docs.sh

# Local preview
uv run mkdocs serve
```

Dependencies: `uv sync --group docs`

## Generated Content - DO NOT EDIT

These are regenerated by `./generate_docs.sh`:
- `subjects-and-types.md`
- `interfaces.md`
- `payloads/` (all files)
- `interfaces/` (all files within docs/)

Generation scripts:
- `scripts/generate_docs_for_subjects_and_types.py` — reads `messages/subjects.yaml` + `messages/payloads/`
- `scripts/generate_docs_for_interfaces.py` — reads `interfaces/`

## Hand-Written Pages (Safe to Edit)

- `index.md` — home page
- `protocol-specification.md` — protocol spec
- `health-monitoring.md` — health monitoring guide
- `how-to-use.md` — usage guide
- `existing-resources.md` — links to related projects

## mkdocs.yml

Located at repo root (`/mkdocs.yml`), not in `docs/`. Key settings:
- Theme: Material, slate scheme
- Navigation: manually defined (not auto-discovered)
- Extensions: attr_list, md_in_html, superfences, tabbed
- Custom JS/CSS: glightbox for image lightboxes (in `docs/assets/`)

## Release

Docs deploy via `uv run mkdocs gh-deploy --force` in the release workflow. Requires protodot + graphviz for proto diagrams.
